《是大臣》《是首相》

我个人主要的评论对象是剧，但是文案主要来自官方小说。

如此经典，以至于政府的ai bot也叫Humphrey（[Government digital document app launching in summer](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48vl3p0nyo)）



### 内容

* DAA给编剧的方便
* 单元剧的前后联系
  * "I shall be telephoning the Secretary of State for Industry. I’m prepared to resign if you block this one" => "it was indeed theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry who had put the boot in"
  * 常驻配角的串联，银行家，Martin，Bill，Frank，PM

* 成长弧线
  * jim：two face；杀手本能，S1E6和S2E6那种恐怖的眼神，一瞬间杀气就出来了
  * benard
  * 首相阶段手段更多，h也没法硬刚了（像YM S1E5一样是硬刚，YPM S1E3则是典型的不敢硬刚），不像大臣时代，除了Dorothy



### 形式

#### 情景喜剧

场景不变，演技，表情与肢体语言，服装

时间的推进一路往前，没有倒叙、全知叙事者、没有内心活动，只有对话，发生在各种地方的对话，办公室、餐桌等等



服装：[The suits of Yes Minister. – RAVINGS IN CINEMASCOPE](https://cinemascopicravings.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/the-suits-of-yes-minister/)

Jim：力求营造出一种与选民更加一致的效果，Hacker的装饰方巾更倾向于松散的放在口袋里，而且多用明亮的色彩，打扮的更像一个平民出身的人，以此营造一个权威但是友好的形象

Humphrey 经常穿单排扣西装，搭配浅色衬衫和方巾，他的领带种类很多，但是都打成完美的半温莎结。Humphrey从来不会看起来衣冠不整，他的所有套装都是量身定制。除了吃瘪的时候

Bernard 随着时间的不同Woolley的服装变化是最多的，在Yes Minister中，Woolley正在摸索熟悉公务员系统，与富有经验的Sir Humphrey相比仍然年轻和稚嫩，也许是为了映射这一点，Bernard的剧中早期着装是十分时髦的，深蓝色单排扣西装——经常是三件套——他常常搭配粉色的衬衫，偶尔像银行家那样搭配领针和袖扣。在YPM中，他的着装有了彻底的改变，几乎和Sir Humphrey传统打扮相同级别，放弃了色彩明亮的衬衫，取而代之的是跟Humphrey相同的白色或蓝色衬衫。

Dorothy就不一样了，服装就相对时尚、鲜艳很多，在一群西装男里鹤立鸡群。也不止是她，其他女性角色大多也都是如此。





#### 戏剧性反讽

喜剧很大部分依靠揭穿自负者的面具

* 小情节上：立马的反差，industrial harmony => strikes；是首相中theres total privacy up here in the flat => in burst two sniffer dogs with tongues hanging out dragging a couple of police dog-handlers behind them, at least it's quite => the bloody brass band started playing on Horse Guards Parade，modernist => Non believer, let the Holy Ghost decide => By drawing lots；S1E3的反差；

* ~~单剧集内的呼应：My lips are sealed；loyalty；~~

* 结构上：比比皆是——你要搞经济节约，我就让你砍自己员工导致部门基本瘫痪 (S1E3)；你要搞去除冗官，我把你整个部门废了 (S1E5)；你要把荣誉和降本挂钩，我给你个法学博士你要不要(S2E2)；你要反对大规模监听电话，我就让你上暗杀名单(S2E3)；你要把艺术馆卖了当作贷款给足球俱乐部，我让你当艺术大臣看你怎么卖(S3E7)；你因为我没给增加national theater预算就想在晚会上喷我，我把你家都扬了(YPM S2E6)...

* 人物塑造：

  * two faced，强烈的对比
  * 掉书袋与强工作能力

  

#### 语言游戏

具体一集一集的分析可见宝藏公众号：[语言游戏丨英国非物质文化遗产《是，大臣》中的语言艺术丨S2E6](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Hotalk1NNGo_udi8wZH5ug)，目录里面有很多，可以一集一集看学英语。

语言方面，除了正常的一些前后呼应的语言meme、witty words外，主要是靠Humphrey的长难句和小天使的掉书袋来作为笑料。

Humphrey的长难句举几个例子：

> Humphrey: To put it absolutely bluntly, Minister, confidential investigations have revealed the existence of certain documents whose provenance is currently unestablished, but whose effect if realised would be to create a cabinet vacancy and precipitate a by-election.
> Jim: What do you mean? 
> Humphrey: You are on a death list.

> Humphrey: Certain informal discussions have taken place, involving a full and frank exchange of views, out of which there arose a series of proposals which on examination proved to indicate certain promising lines of enquiry which when pursued led to the realisation that the alternative courses of action might in fact, in certain circumstances, be susceptible of discreet modification, in one way or another, leading to a reappraisal of the original areas of difference and pointing the way to encouraging possibilities of significant compromise and co-operation which if bilaterally implemented with appropriate give and take on both sides could if the climate were right have a reasonable possibility at the end of the day of leading, rightly or wrongly, to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.
> Jim: Could you summarise this please?

> Humphrey: unfortunately, although the answer was indeed simple, clear and straightforward, there are some difficulty in justifiably assigning to it the fourth of the epithets you applied to the statement inasmuch as the precise correlation between the information he had communicated and the facts insofar as they can be determined and demonstrated is such as to cause epistemological problems of sufficient magnitude to lay upon the logical and semantic resources of the English language a heavier burden than they can reasonably be requested to bear.
> Jim: epistemological, what are you talking about

Humphrey吃瘪的时候则更有反差：

> Humphrey: The identity of this official whose alleged responsibility for this hypothetical oversight has been the subject of recent speculation is not shrouded in quite such impenetrable obscurity as certain previous disclosures may have led you to assume, and, in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, the individual in question was, it may surprise you to learn, the one to whom your present interlocutor is in the habit of identifying by means of the perpendicular pronoun.
> Jim: I beg your pardon?
> Humphrey: It was I.

> Humphrey: I must express in the strongest possible terms my profound opposition to the newly instituted practice which imposes severe and intolerable restrictions on the ingress and egress of senior members of the hierarchy and will, in all probability, should the current deplorable innovation be perpetuated, precipitate a progressive constriction of the channels of communication, culminating in a condition of organisational atrophy and administrative paralysis which will render effectively impossible the coherent and co-ordinated discharge of the function of government within Her Majestys United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
> Jim: You mean you've lost your key? 



Bernard也会这些，但是用的很少。对Humphrey举个例子：

> Bernard: What I mean is it is in relation to a subject that is normally wholly and exclusively within the control of the Civil Service that developments have developed.
> Humphrey: You are speaking in riddles Bernard.
> Bernard: Oh Thank you Sir Humphrey.
> Humphrey: That was not a compliment Bernard!

对Jim则是在一般不想回答问题的时候圆过去，有时候则也有炫技的成分在（比如S3E7）。只有一次是相当之刚猛，那就是在差点被Jim献祭之后的一集(S3E5)：

> Bernard: if you had looked the Trojan Horse in the mouth, you would find Greeks inside. The reason, of course, is that it was the Greeks who gave the Trojan Horse to the Trojans. Therefore, technically it was not a Trojan Horse at all. In fact, it was a Greek Horse. Hence the tag ‘Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes’, which, as the you will recall, is usually and somewhat inaccurately translated as Beware of Greeks Bearing Gifts, or doubtless the you would recall had you not attended the LSE.
> ...
> Bernard: Just as the Trojan Horse was Greek, the tag which you described as Greek was, in fact, Latin. In fact, this is obvious if you consider that the Greeks would hardly suggest bewaring of themselves – if one can use such a participle: bewaring, that is – and the tag can clearly be seen to be Latin rather than Greek not because ‘timeo’ ends in ‘o’ (because the Greek first
> person also ends in ‘o’) – actually, if I may digress, there is a Greek word ‘timao’ meaning ‘I honour’ – but because the ‘os’ ending is a nominative singular termination of the second declension in Greek and an accusative plural in Latin. Incidentally, as a fine point of interest, Danaos is not only the Greek for Greek but also the Latin for Greek. It's very interesting you know.

Bernard说完第一段之后Humphrey已经皱眉并握紧双拳了，说完第二段直接把Humphrey吓得连说了几个Perhaps并且一直看向Bernard，生怕Bernard再次打断他。



我个人最喜欢的是小天使Bernard的pedantic，一些例子：

> Humphrey: I implore you to stay out of theminefield of local government. It is a political graveyard.
> Bernard: Actually, Sir Humphrey, you can’t have a graveyard in a minefield because all the corpses would . . .

> Jim: We can't stab our partners in the back and spit in their faces.
> Bernard: You can’t stab anyone in the back while you spit in their face.

> Jim: We shall just have to grit our teeth and bite on the bullet.
> Bernard: You can't bite a bullet when gritting yout teeth. If you do that...

> Jim: do you think I could? Actually grasp the nettle and take the bull by the horns?
> Bernard: Prime Minister, you cant take the bull by the horns if youre grasping the nettle. I mean, if you grasped the nettle with one hand, you could take the bull by one horn with the other hand, but not by both horns because your hand wouldnt be bit enough, and if you took a bull by only one horn it would be rather dangerous because...

> Jim :The point is, this situation is now a real hot potato. If I dont do something it could become a banana skin.
> Bernard: Excuse me, Minister, a hot potato cant become a banana skin. If you dont do anything a hot potato merely becomes a cold potato.

Bernard很擅长去找到字面意义与语境意义之间的反差并且表达出来





#### 叙述视角

之前的文案都是书里面来的

书中的顺序调整：ym把最后两集调整了顺序，

ypm也是，最后换成了废除教育部那一集

> I took a deep breath. Yes, I said quietly. My plans were turning to dust. Like all my plans. Suddenly I saw, with a real clarity that Id never enjoyed before, that although I might win the occasional policy victory, or make some reforms, or be indulged with a few scraps from the table, nothing fundamental was ever ever going to change.



剧里没有也没法展示的东西：[Calligraphy(note, reply, memo, diary, letter, etc（The Complete Yes Minister）书评](https://book.douban.com/review/13093243/)

剧：表演、神态

书：笔记，内心活动
